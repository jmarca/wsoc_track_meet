## Officiating the track events (running)

The most important task is to get the name and school of the top three
finishers in each event.

### Sprints (10 people)

Each running event, except for the mile and the relays, will need to
have several heats.  At the end of each heat, the top three winners
need to be identified and told that they made it into the next heat,
and where to go to prepare for that heat.

To do that, we will need three officials at the finish line to flag
down those top three finishers.  Then at the starting line, we will
need two other judges, one to start the race, and another to watch for
false starts and call the runners back.

Because the work is largely the same, I think it will be best to have
two teams of 5 handle the 50m and 100m sprints and the 60m hurdles.

### Middle distance

The 200m is likely to have very few heats, perhaps just one big race,
and so I'm going to lump it in with the 400m and mile.  On the other
hand, maybe I'm wrong, in which case it gets lumped with the sprints.

### Long distance (3 to 6 people)

The 400m and the mile will likely only have one race per class.
The start and end point are also at the same place, so we can handle
the race with just three people.  One person starts the race while the
other two watch to make sure the runners behave themselves at the
starting line, then at the finish all three pick out the top three
finishers and get their names/school.


## Race management (aka talking on the loudspeaker) (2 to 4 people)

At least two people are needed make the announcements about what races
are starting, etc.  Ideally, the person talking on the microphone will
only do that, not worry about other stuff.  The other person or people
will keep track of what heats are being run and when in order to feed
the announcer the necessary information.
